11383,47,Foundations of Inference,"One of the foundational aspects of statistical analysis is inference, or the process of drawing conclusions about a larger population from a sample of data. Although counter intuitive, the standard practice is to attempt to disprove a research claim that is not of interest. For example, to show that one medical treatment is better than another, we can assume that the two treatments lead to equal survival rates only to then be disproved by the data. Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis. We also dive into confidence intervals, which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g. how much better one treatment is than another).",r,10

Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis. We also dive into confidence intervals, which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g. how much better one treatment is than another).",r,10

Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis. We also dive into confidence intervals, which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g. how much better one treatment is than another).",r,10

Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis. We also dive into confidence intervals, which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g. how much better one treatment is than another).",r,10

34410,47,Foundations of Inference,"One of the foundational aspects of statistical analysis is inference, or the process of drawing conclusions about a larger population from a sample of data. Although counter intuitive, the standard practice is to attempt to disprove a research claim that is not of interest. For example, to show that one medical treatment is better than another, we can assume that the two treatments lead to equal survival rates only to then be disproved by the data. Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis. We also dive into confidence intervals, which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g. how much better one treatment is than another).",r,10
30791,98,Building Chatbots in Python,"When done well, interacting with a computer through human language is incredibly powerful and also quite fun. Messaging and Voice-Controlled devices are the next big platforms, and conversational computing has a big role to play in creating engaging augmented and virtual reality experiences.

9947,66,Visualizing Time Series Data in Python,"Time series data is omnipresent in the field of Data Science. Whether it is analyzing business trends, forecasting company revenue or exploring customer behavior, every data scientist is likely to encounter time series data at some point during their work. To get you started on working with time series data, this course will provide practical knowledge on visualizing time series data using Python.",python,5
15296,70,Introduction to Relational Databases in SQL,"You have already used SQL for querying data from databases. But did you actually know that there's a whole lot more you can do with databases? You can model different phenomena in your data – and relationships between them. This gives your data structure as well as consistency, which results in better data quality. In this course, you'll experience this firsthand by working with a real-life data set that was used to investigate questionable affiliations of universities. Column by column, table by table, you'll get to unlock and admire the full potential of databases. In between, you'll learn how to create tables and specify their relationships as well as how to enforce data integrity. Also, you'll discover other unique features of database systems, such as constraints.",sql,7
1746,18,Network Analysis in Python (Part 1),"From online social networks such as Facebook and Twitter to transportation networks such as bike sharing systems, networks are everywhere, and knowing how to analyze this type of data will open up a new world of possibilities for you as a Data Scientist.  This course will equip you with the skills to analyze, visualize, and make sense of networks. You'll apply the concepts you learn to real-world network data using the powerful NetworkX library. With the knowledge gained in this course, you'll develop your network thinking skills and be able to start looking at your data with a fresh perspective!",python,9
19271,80,String Manipulation in R with stringr,"Character strings can turn up in all stages of a data science project. You might have to clean messy string input before analysis, extract data that is embedded in text or automatically turn numeric results into a sentence to include in a report. Perhaps the strings themselves are the data of interest, and you need to detect and match patterns within them. This course will help you master these tasks by teaching you how to pull strings apart, put them back together and use stringr to detect, extract, match and split strings using regular expressions, a powerful way to express patterns.",r,7
3772,15,Data-Driven Decision Making in SQL,"In this course, you will learn how to use SQL to support decision making. It is based on a case study about an online movie rental company with a database about customer information, movie ratings, background information on actors and more. You will learn to apply SQL queries to study for example customer preferences, customer engagement, and sales development. This course also covers SQL extensions for online analytical processing (OLAP), which makes it easier to obtain key insights from multidimensional aggregated data.",sql,2
33243,16,Intermediate Functional Programming with purrr,"Have you ever been wondering what the purrr description (“A functional programming toolkit for R”) refers to? Then, you’ve come to the right place! This course will walk you through the functional programming part of purrr - in other words, you will learn how to take full advantage of the flexibility offered by the .f in map(.x, .f) to iterate other lists, vectors and data.frame with a robust, clean, and easy to maintain code. During this course, you will learn how to write your own mappers (or lambda functions), and how to use predicates and adverbs. Finally, this new knowledge will be applied to a use case, so that you’ll be able to see how you can use this newly acquired knowledge on a concrete example of a simple nested list, how to extract, keep or discard elements, how to compose functions to manipulate and parse results from this list, how to integrate purrr workflow inside other functions, how to avoid copy and pasting with purrr functional tools.",r,3
13937,19,Introduction to Databases in Python,"In this Python SQL course, you'll learn the basics of using Structured Query Language (SQL) with Python. This will be useful since whether you like it or not, databases are ubiquitous and, as a data scientist, you'll need to interact with them constantly. The Python SQL toolkit SQLAlchemy provides an accessible and intuitive way to query, build & write to SQLite, MySQL and Postgresql databases (among many others), all of which you will encounter in the daily life of a data scientist.",python,8
15142,92,Foundations of Predictive Analytics in Python (Part 2),"Building good models only succeeds if you have a decent base table to start with. In this course you will learn how to construct a good base table, create variables and prepare your data for modeling. We finish with advanced topics on the matter. If you have not already, you should take <a href=""https://www.datacamp.com/courses/foundations-of-predictive-analytics-in-python-part-1"" target=""_blank"">Foundations of Predictive Analytics in Python (Part 1)</a> first.",python,2
